## Abstraction
Trying to predict the third year daily trip amount by the first two years' data.
## Approaches
+ The first approach is failed because didn't utilize the use of package "pandas," end up with struggling with the data format and didn't understand how the learning model works.
+ Second approach is just started, package "pandas" enhanced the preprocessing process. Thus I can focus on modifying my model.
